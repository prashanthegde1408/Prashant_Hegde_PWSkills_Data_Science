    "The class is a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object. From classes we can construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. User defined objects are created using the class keyword.Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.\n",
